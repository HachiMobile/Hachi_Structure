//Implement React-Native MMKV storage with persist state (support sync)
//The combination of these two libraries makes it possible to persist the app's state, even after the app has been closed or restarted.

//Listeners with react-native-mmkv
// We can use React Native MMKVâ€™s listener feature to track changes in the storage. This is useful to perform certain actions whenever a particular value in the storage changes.
